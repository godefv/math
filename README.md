# What is it ?
This is a c++ math library. It provides :

* **abstract mathematical objects**

  groups, vector spaces, algebras, etc.

* **some specific instances of such objects**

  geometric algebra, which includes complex numbers, quaternions, and much more.
  todo : geometric transformation groups (rotations, translations, isometries, similarities).

* **coordinate free geometry** 

  Never again write something like `Vector3d{1., 2., 0.}` and then the compiler doesn't know in which frame those coordinates are (and maybe you don't either).
  Instead, use meaningful directions like `1.*up+2.*east+0.*north`. 

  But here `0.*north` is superfluous, so just write `up+2*east`, which takes less memory and is faster to process at runtime because ony 2 numbers will be used instead of 3. The library will take care of returning the best types in terms of memory and geometric signification for every math operation or function.

  And if you have several frames, don't bother changing frame explicitly, just define your new frames in terms of the previous ones and use adequate frame vectors directly : `1.3*my_frame_x + 2.4*my_other_frame_z`. 

# Implementation

## strong typing
Mathematical objects and expressions are represented by c++ types. Operations on those types are made by constexpr functions.
It can effectively turn your compiler into a symbolic math software, in which case the resulting program would only print the result that have been computed at compile time.

## extensible dimensions
No need to specify in advance a space in which to work, new types are generated if new dimensions appear in an expression. If you write `auto a=3*x+4*y`, `a` stores two values in a type generated from the expression `"double*x+double*y"`. Then, writing `a+2.5*z` will just generate a larger type holding three values (assuming `z` is not a combination of `x` and `y`).

## small and easy to read
It is small because it exploits centuries of work from mathematicians. They have put many concepts into the most beautiful form they could find : both as general and as simple as possible, which means factorized and simple code.
The library also uses c++17 with concepts, which provides human friendly template programming.

## unit tests
They are a good place to look for examples.
They make sure things work as intended.
