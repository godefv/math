A translation is a transformation on a set of points with the following properties :

* it does not change distances between points
* it does not change angles between directions
* it does not transform any point to itself

The set of translations is a group : 

* any sequence of translations is itself a translation
* any translation can be undone by another translation

This group is commutative : the translations in any sequence of translations can be applied in any order resulting in the same translation at the end.

It is not a finite group, but it is a vector space over a finite set of directions.
